Multisite
=========

The ``PageBundle`` handles multisite out of the box. However due to some
limitation of the Symfony2 API, the multisite support is done around 4 strategies:

* host: you can configure a site per host. This strategy works out of the box
  with no changes.
* host by locale: same than host, but try to retrieve the site by the
  Accept-Language header of the HTTP request.
* host with path: you can configure site per host and per path. This strategy
  requires some changes.
* host with path by locale: same than host with path, but try to retrieve the
  site by the Accept-Language header of the HTTP request.


Host Strategy
-------------

With this strategy it is possible to handle sites like :

* http://sonata-project.org
* http://sonata-project.com
* http://sonata-project.net

Just configure the ``sonata_page`` section as:

.. code-block:: yaml

    sonata_page:
        multisite: host
        [...]

And that's it!


Host By Locale Strategy
------------------------

This strategy handles the same sites than previous one.

Just configure the ``sonata_page`` section as:

.. code-block:: yaml

    sonata_page:
        multisite: host_by_locale
        [...]

And that's it!


Host and Path Strategy
----------------------

With this strategy it is possible to handle sites like :

* http://sonata-project.org
* http://sonata-project.org/beta
* http://sonata-project.com/fr
* http://sonata-project.net


This strategy requires a dedicated ``Request`` object. So you need to alter the
front controller to use the one provided by the ``PageBundle``. To do so, open
files: app.php and app_dev.php to use the request factory ::

    use Sonata\PageBundle\Request\SiteRequest as Request;

Working file example:

.. code-block:: php

  <?php
  
  use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
  use Sonata\PageBundle\Request\SiteRequest;

  $loader = require_once __DIR__.'/../app/bootstrap.php.cache';

  require_once __DIR__.'/../app/AppKernel.php';

  $kernel = new AppKernel('prod', false);
  $kernel->loadClassCache();

  Request::setFactory(function (
    array $query = array(),
    array $request = array(),
    array $attributes = array(),
    array $cookies = array(),
    array $files = array(),
    array $server = array(),
    $content = null
  ) {
    return SiteRequest::create(
      $query,
      $request,
      $attributes,
      $cookies,
      $files,
      $server,
      $content
    );
  });

  $request = Request::createFromGlobals();
  $response = $kernel->handle($request);
  $response->send();
  $kernel->terminate($request, $response);

The last action is to configure the ``sonata_page`` section as:

.. code-block:: yaml

    sonata_page:
        multisite: host_with_path
        [...]

And that's it!


Host and Path By Locale Strategy
---------------------------------

This strategy requires to alter the front controller like the previous one and
to configure the ``sonata_page`` section as:

.. code-block:: yaml

    sonata_page:
        multisite: host_with_path_by_locale
        [...]

And that's it!


.. note::

    If you have a working site with the PageBundle, you just need to create a
    ``Site`` and update the page table and the snapshot table with the correct
    Site ``id`` value.
