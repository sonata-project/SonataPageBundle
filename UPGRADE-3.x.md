===========

### Deprecated

Initializing `Sonata\PageBundle\Block\BreadcrumbBlockService` class without the `menuRegistry` parameter is deprecated, Use `Sonata\BlockBundle\Menu\MenuRegistryInterface` as last argument.

UPGRADE FROM 3.3 to 3.4
=======================

### Unused command option

The `--all` option of `sonata:page:update-core-routes` command is not used and is now deprecated.

UPGRADE FROM 3.1 to 3.2
=======================

### Tests

All files under the ``Tests`` directory are now correctly handled as internal test classes. 
You can't extend them anymore, because they are only loaded when running internal tests. 
More information can be found in the [composer docs](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#autoload-dev).

### Deprecations

The ``SnapshotManager::getPageByName`` method is deprecated and will be removed with the next major release.
